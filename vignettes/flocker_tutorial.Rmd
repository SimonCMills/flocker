`flocker` is an R package for fitting [occupancy models](https://jsocolar.github.io/closureOccupancy/). To date, software for occupancy modeling has required users either to work directly with probabilistic programming languages like Stan or JAGS, or to restrict themselves to simple effects structures in packages like `unmarked`. `flocker` changes that, providing occupancy modelers with a simple formula-based syntax for sophisticated model structures. Based on highly optimized Stan code, `flocker` is also **fast**, especially for large models.

`flocker` is built on R package `brms`, which in turn is a front-end for `Stan`. Thus, mastering `flocker` is mostly a matter of mastering the formula syntax available in `brms`. 

In the remainder of this vignette, we

* define some useful terms 
* explain how to format data for use with `flocker`
* provide an overview of `brms` formula syntax, with links to additional documentation for advanced topics
* illustrate how users can (and should!) specify their own priors 
* review `flocker`'s functionality for posterior prediction and model comparison.

## Installation and feedback
[Installation instructions are available here](https://jsocolar.github.io/flocker). To request features or report bugs (much appreciated!), please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jsocolar/flocker/issues).

## Terms and defintions
The following terms feature importantly in this vignette. Some are not standard in the literature (but we think maybe they should be):

**closure-unit**: The groupings of observations over which [closure](https://jsocolar.github.io/closureOccupancy/) is assumed. In single-species models, a closure-unit corresponds to a "site" or "point". In multi-species models, a closure-unit is a species-site combination. In single-species dynamic models (not yet implemented in `flocker`), a closure-unit is a site-season or site-year combination.

**Z**: The (unobserved) true occupancy state of each closure-unit. We can represent Z as a vector of ones and zeros with one element for each closure-unit: a one if occupied; a zero if unoccupied.

$\boldsymbol{\psi}$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}$: The occupancy ($\psi$) and detection ($\theta$) probabilities. In many models, both $\psi$ and $\theta$ will vary across closure-units. In some models $\theta$ will additionally vary across repeated sampling events within a closure-unit.

**Q** The (observed) detection/nondetection state of each closure-unit (i.e. does the unit have at least one detection in the data or not). As for Z, we represent Q as a vector of ones and zeros.

**rep-constant**, **rep-varying**: We refer to models where $\theta$ is constant across repeated sampling events within closure-units as *rep-constant models*, as contrasted with *rep-varying models* that incorporate event-specific detection covariates. It turns out that rep-constant models enable a more efficient parametrization of the likelihood than rep-varying models.

**unit covariates**, **event covariates**: We refer to any covariate that does not vary across sampling events within closure-units as a "unit covariate". This includes covariates that are intrinsically properties of single closure-units (e.g. the elevations of sites in a single-species model), covariates that are intrinsically properties of groups of closure units (e.g. elevations of sites in a multispecies model), and covariates that are intrinsically properties of sampling events but happen to be constant within all closure-units (e.g. observer in a sampling design where every site is visited by exactly one observer). We refer to any covariate that varies across sampling events within covariates as an "event covariate". Note that while unit covariates may appear in either the occupancy or the detection formula, event covariates are restricted to the detection formula. Models that incorporate event covariates are *rep-varying* (see above); those that do not are *rep-constant*.

## Data formatting
The main function in `flocker` for fitting occupancy models, called `flock()`, expects a highly specific and somewhat peculiar data format. The function `make_flocker_data()` formats data for use with `flock()` automatically. At a minimum, `make_flocker_data()` expects a matrix or dataframe of detection/non-detection data. Rows represent closure-units, columns represent repeated sampling events within closure-units, and entries must be `0` (nondetection), `1` (detection), or `NA` (no corresponding sampling event). The data must be formatted so that all `NA`s are trailing within their rows. For example, if some units were sampled four times and other three times, the three sampling events must be treated as events 1, 2, and 3 (with the fourth event `NA`) rather than as events 1, 3, and 4 (with the second event `NA`) or any other combination.

Many occupancy models also include covariates that influence occupancy or detection probabilities. Unit covariates (see *Terms and definitions* above) can be passed to `make_flocker_data()` as a dataframe with the same number of rows as the observation matrix and data in the same order as the rows of the observation matrix. Columns are covariates, and we recommend using informative column names. *Event covariates* (see *Terms and definitions* above) can be passed as a named list of matrices whose elements `[i, j]` are the covariate values for the sampling event represented by the corresponding position of the observation matrix. Again, we recommend using informative names for the list elements. If the corresponding observation is `NA`, then the value of the event covariate does not matter.

Here's an example of how we format data, using example data provided via the `example_flocker_data()` function:
```{r data formatting}
library(flocker)
ex_data <- example_flocker_data()
names(ex_data)
names(ex_data$event_covs)
head(ex_data$obs) # observation matrix
head(ex_data$unit_covs) # observation matrix
head(ex_data$event_covs$ec1)
flocker_data <- make_flocker_data(obs = ex_data$obs, 
                                  unit_covs = ex_data$unit_covs, 
                                  event_covs = ex_data$event_covs)
```

## Model formulas
Once we've formatted data with `make_flocker_data()`, we are ready to fit an occupancy model using the `flock()` function. Internally, `flock` calls `brms::brm()`, and the key to mastering `flock()` is to master the formula synax from `brms`. We supply formulas for both occupancy and detection. Simple formulas follow the same syntax as R's `lm()` function. For example: 
```{r lm, eval=FALSE}
flock(f_occ = ~ uc1, 
      f_det = ~ 1, 
      flocker_data = flocker_data)
```

### Random effects
Simple random effects follow `lme4` syntax, including advanced `lme4` syntax is supported, including `||` for uncorrelated effects and `/` and `:` for expansion of multiple grouping terms. Here's a simple example:
```{r lme4, eval=FALSE}
flock(f_occ = ~ uc1 + (1 | species), 
      f_det = ~ 1, 
      flocker_data = flocker_data)
```
When a model includes multiple random effects with the same grouping term, by default they are modeled as correlated *within* the occupancy or detection formulas, but as uncorrelated *between* formulas. For example, the code below estimates a single correlation for the intercept and slope in the occupancy sub-model.
```{r lme4_2, eval=FALSE}
flock(f_occ = ~ uc1 + (1 + uc1 | species), 
      f_det = ~ ec1 + (1 | species), 
      flocker_data = flocker_data)
```
However, this assumption can easily be relaxed using the `|<ID>|` syntax from `brms`. The `ID` is an arbitrary character string representing a group of terms to model as correlated. The below code, for example, models correlated intercepts in the occupancy and detection sub-models, and correlated effects of `sc1` on occupancy and `vc1` on detection, but no correlations between the intercepts and the slopes in either sub-model:
```{r lme4_3, eval=FALSE}
flock(f_occ = ~ uc1 + (1 |g1| species) + (0 + uc1 |g2| species), 
      f_det = ~ ec1 + (1 |g1| species) + (0 + ec1 |g2| species), 
      flocker_data = flocker_data)
```
For more on `brms` syntax for random effects syntax, see the [documentation here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/vignettes/brms_multilevel.pdf).

### Generalized additive models
Via `brms`, `flocker` supports `mgcv` syntax for thin-plate regression splines (`s()`) and tensor product smooths (`t2()`). For example:
```{r mgcv, eval=FALSE}
flock(f_occ = ~ s(uc1), 
      f_det = ~ 1, 
      flocker_data = flocker_data)
```

### Other advanced models
`brms` is capable of fitting a variety of additional effects structures. We believe that the following structures should translate directly to `flocker`, but these remain untested. As we test them and verify adequate performance, we will update this vignette with examples.

#### Phylogenetic models
Phylogenetic effects can be included by providing a covariance matrix as a `data2` argument and using the `gr()` function to link species identities in `flocker_data` with the supplied covariance matrix. Note that phylogenetic effects can be included in either the occupancy component, the detection component, or both! 
```{r, phylo, eval=FALSE} 
# simulate an example phylogeny
phylogeny <- ape::rtree(30, tip.label = paste0("sp_", 1:30))

# calculate covariance matrix
A <- ape::vcv.phylo(phylogeny)

ff1 <- flock(f_occ = ~ 1 + (1|gr(species, cov = A)), 
             f_det = ~  1 + ec1 + (1|species), 
             flocker_data = flocker_data, 
             data2 = list(A = A))

ff2 <- flock(f_occ = ~ 1 + (1|gr(species, cov = A)), 
             f_det = ~  1 + ec1 + (1|gr(species, cov = A)), 
             flocker_data = flocker_data, 
             data2 = list(A = A))

```

[See here](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/articles/brms_phylogenetics.html) for further details about specifying phylogenetic effects in `brms`.

#### Spatial autoregressive models
[See here](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/reference/car.html) for details about conditional autoregressive (CAR) models in `brms`. Note that if the spatial effect is applied to occupancy, it is essential closure-units be grouped such that many groups contain more than one unit. With just one unit per group (the `brms` default if no grouping is supplied), the logit-scale residual is not identified. Note that `flock()` directly accepts a `data2` argument that it can pass to `brms` as necessary.

#### Monotonic effects
[See here](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/articles/brms_monotonic.html) for relevant `brms` documentation.

#### Measurement error
[See here](http://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/reference/me.html) for relevant `brms` documentation.

## Additional fitting arguments
`flock` will pass any relevant parameters forward to `brms::brm()`, giving the user important control over the algorithmic details of how the model is fit. See `?brms::brm` for details. To speed up the execution, we recommend supplying the argument `backend = "cmdstanr"`. This requires the cmdstanr package and a working installation of cmdstan; [see here](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) for instructions to get started and further details.

## Prior specification
Priors can be implemented as they would with any `brms` model. Priors can be specified using `set_prior()`, with priors specified for groups of parameters (via `class`) or individual parameters (via `coef`). The priors used for a particular model can be retrieved using `prior_summary()`

```{r, priors, eval=FALSE}
user_prior <- c(brms::set_prior("normal(0, 3)", class="b"), 
                brms::set_prior("normal(0, 2)", class="Intercept"), 
                brms::set_prior("normal(0, 1)", coef="ec1"))

ff <- flock(f_occ = ~ uc1 + uc2 + (1|species), 
            f_det = ~  ec1 + ec2 + (1|species), 
            flocker_data = flocker_data, 
            prior = user_prior)

brms::prior_summary(ff)
```

Note that if there are parameters shared between both the occupancy and detection model formulas, e.g. 
```{r, priors_2, eval=FALSE}
ff <- flock(f_occ = ~ uc1 + (1|species), 
              f_det = ~  uc1 + ec2 + (1|species), 
              flocker_data = fd, prior=user_prior)
```
then there will be two entries for each of the shared parameters in the prior table (`uc1` in this example). Specifying a prior for each parameter individually can be done with reference to the `dpar` column, e.g.:
```{r, priors_3, eval=FALSE}
user_prior <- c(brms::set_prior("normal(0, 1)", coef = "uc1"), 
                brms::set_prior("normal(0, 3)", coef = "uc1", dpar = "occ"))
```
where the `uc1` parameter in the occupancy component is specified by the addition of the `dpar` argument, and the `uc1` parameter in the detection component is specified without reference to `dpar`.
              

## Post-processing
`flocker` provides functions for three main types of post-processing. `get_Z()` provides the posterior distribution for the latent occupancy state. `predict_flocker()` provides posterior predictions at the observed points (e.g. for use in posterior predictive checking) or for new data. `loo_flocker()` and `loo_compare_flocker()` both provide functionality for model comparison. See below for details on all three types of post-processing. Both posterior predictions and model comparison rely on subtle aspects of the occupancy model likelihood that we explain in more detail [here](https://jsocolar.github.io/likelihoodOccupancy/).

### Posterior Z
The function `get_Z()` returns the posterior distribution of occupancy probabilities across the closure-units. The output is a matrix where rows are posterior iterations, columns are closure-units, and values are draws from the posterior distribution of occupancy probabilities. For example:

```{r get_Z, eval=FALSE}
ff <- flock(f_occ = ~ uc1, 
      f_det = ~ 1, 
      flocker_data = flocker_data)
get_Z(ff)
```

`get_Z()` accepts several additional arguments that control the way that posterior is obtained and the values of returned. See `?get_Z` for details.

### Posterior predictions
The funtion `predict_flocker()` provides posterior predictions. By default, predictions are provided for the covariate data to which the model were fit, but predictions to new data are also possible via the `new_data` argument. The output differs for rep-constant and rep-varying models. For rep-constant models, a matrix where rows are iterations, columns are units, and values are the number of detections. For rep-varying models, an array whose first dimension is units, second dimension is sampling events, third dimension is iterations, and values are 1, 0, or NA, representing detection, nondetection, and no corresponding sampling event.  For example:

```{r predict_flocker, eval=FALSE}
ff <- flock(f_occ = ~ uc1, 
      f_det = ~ 1, 
      flocker_data = flocker_data)
predict_flocker(ff)
```
`predict_flocker()` accepts several additional arguments that control the way that posterior is obtained and the values of returned. See `?predict_flocker` for details.

### Model comparison
`flocker` supports computationally efficient approximate leave-one-out cross-validation via R package `loo` using a method commonly known as PSIS-LOO. This method generally provides superior performance to other computationally efficient model performance criteria (e.g. WAIC), and it comes with diagnostics that signal when the approximation is unreliable. Importantly, when diagnostics indicate that PSIS-LOO is unreliable, other model-comparison metrics such as WAIC are even less reliable. For details about PSIS-LOO, see `loo` package documentation and:

[Vehtari, A., Gelman, A., & Gabry J. (2016). Practical Bayesian model evaluation using leave-one-out cross-validation and WAIC. In Statistics and Computing, doi:10.1007/s11222-016-9696-4. arXiv preprint arXiv:1507.04544.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04544)

[Vehtari, A., Simpson, D., Gelman, A., Yao, Y., and Gabry, J. (2019). Pareto smoothed importance sampling. preprint arXiv:1507.02646](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02646)

The most straightforward way to compare models fit with `flocker` is the function `loo_compare_flocker()`. This function takes a list of flocker_fit objects as its argument and returns a model comparison table based on the difference in the expected log predictive density (elpd) between models. This table is a `compare.loo` object from `loo::loo_compare()`. The "leave-one-out" holdouts consist of entire closure-units, not single sampling events (see [here for details of why](https://jsocolar.github.io/likelihoodOccupancy/)). 

```{r LOO, eval=FALSE}
ff1 <- flock(f_occ = ~ uc1, 
      f_det = ~ 1, 
      flocker_data = flocker_data)

ff2 <- flock(f_occ = ~ uc1, 
      f_det = ~ ec1 + ec2, 
      flocker_data = flocker_data)

loo_compare_flock(list(ff1 = ff1, ff2 = ff2))
```

Flocker also provides the function `loo_flocker()` to return a table of `elpd_loo`, `p_loo`, and `looic` estimates from `loo::loo()` or `brms::loo()` (the former for rep-varying models, the latter for rep-constant models). 

For more about PSIS-LOO with `flocker_fit` objects, see [flocker's LOO vignette](MAKE THIS).
