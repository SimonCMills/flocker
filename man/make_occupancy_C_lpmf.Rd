\title{Create Stan code for likelihood function occupancy_C_lpmf for rep-constant model.
Primarily for internal use in \code{flock()}.
The purpose of defining this custom family, rather than using brms's zero-inflated 
binomial, is to ensure that the occupancy parameters are interpretable as though
values of 1 in the marginalized state reflect occupancy rather than non-
occupancy.}

\value{
Character string of Stan code corresponding to occupancy_C_lpmf
