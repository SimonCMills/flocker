The `flocker` R package enables users to fit flexible occupancy models using 
the same extended `lme4` formula syntax employed by R package `brms`. Also 
included are functions to format data for occupancy modeling. `flocker` is 
under active development. Soon to be included are functions to extract 
estimates, predictions, posterior predictive checks, and model comparison 
criteria from fitted occupancy models.

Compared to existing R packages for fitting occupancy models, `flocker` is 
substantially more flexible in the variety of single-season models that can 
be fit, and contains advanced functionality for model comparison and 
checking.

### Getting started
To get started, check out our 
[tutorial vignette, available here](https://jsocolar.github.io/flocker/articles/flocker_tutorial.html). 
For installation instructions, see below.

### Installation
Install `flocker` in R with
```
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jsocolar/flocker")
```
`flocker` requires a working version of either Rstan or cmdstan, which are 
interfaces to [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/), a state-of-the-art the 
probabilistic programming language. If using Rstan, we strongly recommend 
installing the development version rather than the CRAN version. In a fresh 
R session, do
```
# Uncomment the next line if you have previously installed rstan
# remove.packages(c("StanHeaders", "rstan"))
install.packages("StanHeaders", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
install.packages("rstan", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
```
To use cmdstan, you must install R package `cmdstanr` with
```
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
```
You must additionally install cmdstan itself. We strongly recommend using
`cmdstanr` to manage the cmdstan installation:
```
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```
Both Rstan and cmdstan require a working C++ toolchain, which has posed occasional 
complications for Stan users. 
[See here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started) for 
Rstan-focused advice on installing the toolchain, and 
[see here](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html) for cmdstan-focused 
advice. If you encounter toolchain issues that you are unable to troubleshoot, 
ask for help at https://discourse.mc-stan.org/.
