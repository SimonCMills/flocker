The `flocker` R package enables users to fit flexible occupancy models using 
the same extended `lme4` formula syntax employed by R package `brms`. Also 
included are functions to format data for occupancy modeling. `flocker` is 
under active development. Soon to be included are functions to extract 
estimates, predictions, posterior predictive checks, and model comparison 
criteria from fitted occupancy models.

Compared to existing R packages for fitting occupancy models, `flocker` is 
substantially more flexible in the variety of single-season models that can 
be fit, including 
* sophisticated random effect structures
* generalized additive models
* phylogenetic models
* spatial autoregressive models
* monotonic effects
* measurement error

COMING SOON
* model selection with LOO
* posterior prediction

### Installation
Install `flocker` with 
```
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jsocolar/flocker")
```
`flocker` requires a working version of either Rstan or cmdstan, which are 
interfaces to Stan, a state-of-the-art the probabilistic programming language. 
For more about Stan, see https://mc-stan.org/.
If using Rstan, we strongly recommend installing the development version 
rather than the CRAN version. In a fresh R session, do
```
# Uncomment the next line if you have previously installed rstan
# remove.packages(c("StanHeaders", "rstan"))
install.packages("StanHeaders", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
install.packages("rstan", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
```
If using cmdstan, you must have package `cmdstanr`. Download `cmdstanr` with
```
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))
```
To install cmdstan, we recommend using `cmdstanr` with
```
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```
Stan itself requires a working C++ toolchain, which in the past has occasionally posed
complications for Stan users. For Rstan-focused advice on installing the toolchain, 
consult https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started.
For cmdstan-focused advice, consult 
https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html. 
If you encounter toolchain issues that you are unable to troubleshoot, 
feel free to ask for help at https://discourse.mc-stan.org/.
